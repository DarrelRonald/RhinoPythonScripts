# RhinoPythonScripts
Scripts for use in Rhino 3D and Grasshopper.
These are public scripts that can perhaps be of use in day-to-day projects and learning.

## Utilities
* __ListOfRhinoCommands__ (includes: .py, .gha): this sorts a list of all `Rhino.Commands` that can be accessed through RhinoCommon. It is a tool for seeing quickly what commands are available. You can also copy the output panel contents and paste into an excel sheet.
* __ScriptContextChanger__ (includes different: .py, .gha): these are more educational code blocks. However, if you're writing python scripts using RhinoCommon, you will sometimes need to change the `scriptcontext.doc`
* __ImportSysExplorer_0.1.0__ (includes: .gha): This ghPython module imports the sys module from IronPython and exports to panels both `sys.builtin_module_names` and the `sys.path`.
* __PythonTemplate_0.1.0__ (includes: .py): This python script has the most important python template elements.
