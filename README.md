# RhinoPythonScripts
Scripts for use in Rhino 3D and Grasshopper.
These are public scripts that can perhaps be of use in day-to-day projects and learning.

## Utilities
* __ListOfRhinoCommands__ (includes: .py, .gha): this sorts a list of all Rhino.Commands that can be accessed through RhinoCommon. It is a tool for seeing quickly what commands are available. You can also copy the output panel contents and paste into an excel sheet.
* __ScriptContextChanger__ (includes different: .py, .gha): these are more educational code blocks. However, if you're writing python scripts using RhinoCommon, you will sometimes need to change the scriptcontext.doc
